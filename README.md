# Election Analysis


## Overview of Project and Purpose

This project analyzed election data from a congressional election in a district in Colorado that contained three counties using the coding language Python. The task was to audit their election result and return vote counts and percentages for each candidate, each county, and determine the winner of the election and the county with the largest voter turnout.


## Analysis of Election Outcomes

By a pretty clear margin Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 total votes. The other two candidates were Charles Casper Stockham with 85,213 votes and Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 votes and a share of 23.0% and 3.1% respectively. The number of total votes in this election was 369,711.

The county with the highest voter turnout was Denver. That county made up 82.8% of the vote (306,055 total votes). It is unclear what the voter turnout, votes compared to eligible voters, was. Jefferson county made up 10.5% of the votes and Arapahoe 6.7%.

## Challenges in the Project

Challenges in this project were mostly around using a new coding language, Python. The asynchronus modules provided me with a solid foundation, however, it was a challenge to adapt the existing code to determine and output county level data. The structure of the code was very useful but I found myself mixing up my own created variables and dictionaries which led me to debugging mostly by looking up error messages and a long process of trial and error.


## Conclusion

In performing this analysis, I would recommend to the election commission that this is a low cost and rapid tool for auditing the elections. The code could be adapted easily for any congressional district based on the format of the .csv file. 

Additionally, with some slight modifications and testing, it could be applied to local races as well as statewide races and perhaps the presidential election.

It seems like a big win for quickly, accurately, and inexpensively auditing elections around the state.
